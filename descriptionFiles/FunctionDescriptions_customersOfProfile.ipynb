    "In customersOfProfile function, we will use the sales matrix of customers (whose detailed explanation can be found on the description of recommendProducts function). Sales matrix is two-dimensional representation of the sales records whose rows represent customers and columns represent products. For this function, we use level 3 hierarchy of products (IdUrunGrup3 information). Each data point on sales matrix reflects how much money a customer spent for a product group. \n",
